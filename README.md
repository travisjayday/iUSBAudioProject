# iUSBAudioProject
Software enabling macOS audio playback on an iOS device over USB. 

# Structure
`USBAudioDriver.driver` is a macOS userland system extension that creates a virtual audio IO device. 
This audio device feeds its output to its input. 
Setting this audio device as the system default audio, then reading from it allows us to capture all system audio. 
The driver's source is in `USBAudioDriver/USBAudioDriver.c`

`iAudioServer` is a macOS userland application that uses `usbmuxd` to scan for, connect to, and transmit data to connected iOS devices. 
It reads from the virutal audio device and sends captured data to connected iOS devices. 

`iAudioClient` is an iOS application that listens for incoming connections initiated by `iAudioServer`. 
Upon connection, it plays back the audio transmitted by `iAudioServer`, i.e. the audio generated by the virtual audio IO device, i.e. system output audio.
